            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3>LaxMap.app?</h3>
			<p>Back in 2010, when I first started playing lacrosse, I have a vague memory of a website that let you discover lacrosse events on an interactive map.<br>I'm not even sure if that memory is entirely accurate, but since I haven't been able to find anything similar, I took it upon myself to recreate it, with a modern twist.<br>I recall that original site was run by just one person. You'd submit your event details, and with a bit of luck, your tournament would eventually show up on the map.<br>My goal with this new version was to empower the users. Here, you can directly upload and manage your events. The moment you add an event, it's live on the map.</p>
            
			<h3>Featured events? â˜…</h3>
			<p>Yes, for a ridiculous fee (1â‚¬, of which I get half from Paypal ðŸ¤£) you can make your event highlighted. <br>This means that it will be highlighted in the list, will always be at the top and will always be shown even if it does not reflect the filters requested by the user.
<br></p><p>In short it will always be visible!</p>
			
			<h3>How can I edit/delete an event?</h3>
			<p>After you add an event you will get an <b>ID</b>.<br>Use it on the <a href="https://laxmap.app/edit-event.html" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Edit Event</a> page to edit the data you want or remove the event.<br></p><p>Can't remember the ID? No problem! <a href="mailto:jakkolo@gmail.com" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Contact Me</a> indicating the name of the tournament you would like to edit and I will answer as soon as possible.</p>
			
			<h3>Are past events also shown?</h3>
			<p>No, once the event has passed it is no longer displayed on the map to keep everything neat and tidy.</p>
			
			<h3>How can I support the project?</h3>
			<p>Your support helps us cover the costs of running and maintaining <b>LaxMap.app</b>, allowing us to continue providing free event listings and new features for the lacrosse community.</p>
            <p>Every contribution, big or small, makes a difference and is greatly appreciated!</p>
